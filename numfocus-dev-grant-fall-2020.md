**Proposal Title:** Funding for improving nteract documentation

**Two Sentence Summary of Proposal:**

The nteract project is seeking funding to support hiring a technical writer to add new documentation for the nteract core SDK. This documentation will make it easier for developers to build their own notebook-based UIs and reduce the maintenance burden for the nteract core team.

**Description of Proposal (750 words):**

The nteract core SDK is a collection of React components and JavaScript APIs that developers can use to implement their own Jupyter-based notebook applications.

The nteract project seeks funding to hire a technical writing to produce the following documentation for the project:

- Conceptual (tutorial-style) documentation on how to implement a React-based notebook application using the nteract core SDK
- Conceptual documentation on the Jupyter ecosystem and how different components of the nteract core SDK plug in to it

We anticipate that this documentation work will take a minimum of 50 hours for a professional technical writer to complete.

**The Benefit to Project/Community (400 words):**

New documentation will benefit developers building on top of the nteract core SDK in the following ways:

- Provide examples and sample implementations for common scenarios
- Provide conceptual docs for major topics in the nteract core SDK

New documentation will also benefit the nteract core team in the following ways:

- Reduce the amount of time maintainers spend answering questions about the API
- Provide an existing infrastructure for maintainers and contributors to continue adding documentation

In addition to improving the experience for developers and maintainers, improving our documentation will also help increase user retention and expansion for the nteract core SDK.

**Amount Requested:** $5,000

**Brief Budget Justification (How will the money be spent?):**

The money will be allocated to the payment of a technical writing contractor to support documenting the our API surface area and desktop application.

**Timeline of Deliverables:**

We intend to complete the documentation work by February 2021. We anticipate that the timeline for the project will proceed as follows:

- November - December: Contractor search and on-boarding
- January: Technical writer contributes documentation changes to projects.
- February: Polish and announce new documentation page.
