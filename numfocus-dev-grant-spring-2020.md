**Proposal Title:** Funding for implementation of new nteract desktop app UI

**Two Sentence Summary of Proposal:**

The nteract project is seeking funding to support hiring a front-end development contractor to implement a new UI for the nteract desktop app. This new UI will improve the accessibility and usability of the nteract desktop app, improving the experience for existing desktop users and increasing the adoption of the desktop app.

**Description of Proposal (750 words):**

The nteract desktop app is a cross-platform desktop application that allows users to view, edit, and execute Jupyter notebooks. The current nteract desktop user interface has remained the same for around five years and few change have been made. During that time, we've received feedback from users about usability and accessibility deficiencies in the desktop UI.

In spring 2019, we invested project resources to hire a design contract to create a new UX for the nteract desktop application based on user feedback that had been collected over the past few years. The nteract project is seeking funding to support hiring a front-end development contractor to implement this revamped UI.

Improving the user experience of the nteract desktop app is a paramount priority for us. Satisified users are engaged users who are eager to promote nteract projects to their colleagues, make donations to the nteract project, and contribute to the nteract open source community. We believe that making this investment in our UX will contribute greatly to the long-term health of the project.

We anticipate that this task will take a capable contractor around 120 hours to complete with an additional 60 hours allocated for follow-on work. A NumFOCUS small projects grant will help offset the labor costs of this project on the nteract project.

**The Benefit to Project/Community (400 words):**

The implementation of these UI changes will improve the accessibility and usability of the nteract desktop application. The designs have already been implemented by a previous nteract contractor and feedback from the community on these designs has been solicited on GitHub, Twitter, and Discourse. From this feedback, we've learned that the new designs will:

- Improve the discoverability for common actions in the nteract desktop app
- Make it easier for users to edit multiple Jupyter notebooks in the nteract desktop app
- Raise the nteract desktop app to an AA accessibility rating according to Website Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0).

**Amount Requested:** $5,000

**Brief Budget Justification (How will the money be spent?):**

The money will be allocated to the payment of a front-end development contractor focusing on implementing the new design.

**Timeline of Deliverables:**

We intended to ship the revamped UX in the June release of the nteract desktop application. The timeline for the project is broken down as follows:

- March to early April: Recruitment and onboarding for a development contractor role
- Late April to end of May: Implementation work
- June: Testing, validation, and polish
- June 29th: Target release date
